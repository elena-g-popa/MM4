				<p>Put simply, a computer’s motherboard connects all its other parts together. Everything that makes a computer work, from its CPU to its RAM to its hard disk, plugs into the motherboard. A motherboard turns a pile of components into a computer.</p>

				<p>But there’s more to it than that, of course. Luckily, we’ve gone and explained all in the following article, so read on for a full breakdown.</p>

				<h2>1 & 2 - Graphics (monitor) connectors</h2>
				<p>Different motherboards have different connectors, such as DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI, and sometimes the older VGA. You’ll need a port that matches the one on your monitor, but bear in mind a DVI port can be used with an HDMI monitor and vice versa by using cheap adaptors (but it won’t transmit any sound).</p>

				<h2>3 - CPU (processor) socket</h2>
				<p>This is where the CPU, or processor, plugs in. Modern computers all 	have large cooling devices on top of the CPU, normally consisting of a block of metal with fins and a fan. The socket is carefully designed so the processor will only fit in the right way around.</p>

				<h2>4 - RAM (memory) slots</h2>
				<p>Most desktop PCs have either two or four slots for RAM. More slots mean you can fit more RAM, up to the maximum specified in the motherboard’s manual. In laptops, RAM slots are often the only part of the motherboard the user can replace.</p>

				<h2>5 - Northbridge</h2>
				<p>A northbridge or host bridge is one of the two chips in the core logic chipset architecture on a PC motherboard, the other being the southbridge. Unlike the southbridge, northbridge is connected directly to the CPU via the front-side bus (FSB) and is thus responsible for tasks that require the highest performance.</p>

				<h2>6 - Expansion slots</h2>
				<p>These are for adding extra components to your PC, such as graphics or sound cards. There are two main types of expansion slots: PCI Express and the now-obsolete PCI. PCI Express slots come in three sizes and speed ratings: x1, x4, and x16, to suit different types of card.</p>

				<h2>7 - Southbridge</h2>
				<p>The southbridge is one of the two chips in the core logic chipset on a personal computer (PC) motherboard, the other being the northbridge. The southbridge typically implements the slower capabilities of the motherboard in a northbridge/southbridge chipset computer architecture.</p>

				<h2>8 - Storage connectors</h2>
				<p>These connectors are for mechanical hard disks, solid-state storage devices (SSDs) and optical storage devices such as DVD writers.</p>

				<h2>9 - 20 Pin Power Connector</h2>
				<p>Not much to say about this bad boy.</p>

				<h2>10 - Network port</h2>
				<p>Not all laptops have wired network ports, but they’re still found on practically all desktop PCs. This is where you plug in an Ethernet (network) cable to create a wired, as opposed to wireless, network connection to a home internet router or the office network. All modern motherboards have Gigabit Ethernet ports, also called 10/100/1000, which means they can transfer data at 1,000 megabits per second (Mbit/s), or a theoretical maximum of 125 megabytes per second (MB/s).</p>
