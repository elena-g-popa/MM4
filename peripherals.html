		<h1>Peripherals - or as I like to call them:<span>accessories</span></h1>
		<p>In order to make use of the beautiful assembly of compenents detailed on the other page, the motherboard, we need the help of different instruments: peripherals.</p>
		<p>They can be divided in 3 categories</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Input devices</li>
			<li>2. Output devices</li>
			<li>3. Storage devices</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Peripheral devices can be external or internal. For example, a printer is an external device that you connect using a cable, while an optical disc drive is typically located inside the computer case. Internal peripheral devices are also referred to as integrated peripherals. When most people refer to peripherals, they typically mean external ones.</p>
		
		<p>The concept of what exactly is 'peripheral' is therefore somewhat fluid. For a desktop computer, a keyboard and a monitor are considered peripherals - you can easily connect and disconnect them and replace them if needed. For a laptop computer, these components are built into the computer system and can't be easily removed.</p>
		
		<p>The term 'peripheral' also does not mean it is not essential for the function of the computer. Some devices, such as a printer, can be disconnected and the computer will keep on working just fine. However, remove the monitor of a desktop computer and it becomes pretty much useless.</p>
